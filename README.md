# Eniac-Magist
### SQL/Tableau-Project from DataScience-Bootcamp


Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded in Spain and it has grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.
Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem, for Eniac, is the lack of knowledge of such a market.


Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale.


There are two main concerns for Eniac to partner with Magist:


1. Eniac’s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?


To find the answer to these questions, Data-Exploration using MySQL Workbench and Data-Visulation using Tableau was done in this project.
